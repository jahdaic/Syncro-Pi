# Syncro Pi

This is a project that I created with the intention of putting a simple Raspberry Pi powered computer into my VW Vanagon's gauge cluster.

The capabilities of this app have already grown way beyond what I originally envisioned and I'm still working on adding new functionality.



## Todo

* [x] Fix Spotify album art size resizing
* [ ] Add unit conversion to Weather
* [ ] Add unit conversion to Performance
* [ ] Clean up Location code
* [ ] Finish Gyroscope component

## Setup

### Hardware

Becuase this was such a specific use case, I can't necessarily help you get the hardware set up to integrate it into your car. However, I will create a list of all the parts I used to put together my device.

You can run this on any hardware with a browser, but for my specific setup, I used a Raspberry Pi with and LCD screen. Below is a list of the parts that I used:

* Computer - [Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/)
  * Heatsink - [Geekworm 10mm Aluminum Heatsink](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09QMBCXLB?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=jahdai-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=cacf8be0a3ebdf149d9de5a73aa7e3d7&camp=1789&creative=9325)
* Screen - [iUniker 3.5" LCD Touchscreen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H8ZY89H/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=jahdai-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=4a085295243ef23e00f1988dbfefce2c&camp=1789&creative=9325)
* GPS - [DIYmalls BN-808 USB GPS Receiver](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B098LB339F/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=jahdai-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=dc7c7b0b40198838e2436980b5200f79&camp=1789&creative=9325)

### Software

#### Weather API

#### Spotify API

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
